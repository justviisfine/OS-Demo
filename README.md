Priority Inversion
Priority inversion occurs when a higher-priority task is forced to wait because a lower-priority task is holding a resource that it needs. This can significantly degrade system performance, especially in real-time systems.
Effects: The primary effect is that high-priority tasks are delayed by low-priority tasks, which can lead to missed deadlines or degraded system responsiveness. In extreme cases, priority inversion can cause critical tasks to fail, resulting in severe system malfunctions.
Mitigation Techniques: Techniques like priority inheritance (where the lower-priority task temporarily inherits the priority of the blocked higher-priority task) or priority ceiling (where tasks run at a higher priority while holding certain resources) are commonly used to mitigate priority inversion.

Deadlock
A deadlock is a situation where a set of tasks are unable to proceed because each is waiting for a resource held by another in the set. This creates a circular wait, where no task can release resources and none can make progress.

The 4 Types of Deadlocks:
Mutual Exclusion: At least one resource is non-shareable.
Hold and Wait: Tasks hold resources while waiting for others.
No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a task.
Circular Wait: There is a closed chain of tasks, each waiting for a resource held by the next.
Mitigation Techniques: Deadlocks can be avoided using deadlock prevention (modifying resource allocation policies), deadlock avoidance (e.g., Bankerâ€™s algorithm), or deadlock detection and recovery (monitoring and intervening when deadlocks occur).

The Simulation:
In this project, a home automation system is simulated with three priority levels of tasks, represented by three LEDs. Each priority handles different aspects:
Low Priority: Temperature logging.
Medium Priority: Detecting temperatures.
High Priority: Security system (responding to disturbances).
Deadlock Scenario: Triggered by a sudden spike in temperature.
Priority Inheritance: To show mitigation.

Results
Case 1: Normal Run
Low Priority: Executed. Logs temperature (temperatureLow).
Medium Priority: Executed. Measures temperature (temperatureMedium).
High Priority: Executed. Activates security system.

Case 2: Deadlock
Low Priority: Executed. Begins logging temperature (sharedTemperature).
Medium Priority: Waits for the shared variable (sharedTemperature), which is in use.
High Priority: Waits for low priority to release the shared resource (sharedTemperature).

Case 3: Priority Inversion
Low Priority: Executed. Logs temperature (sharedTemperature) first.
High Priority: Waits while low priority holds the shared resource (sharedTemperature).
Medium Priority: Executed after high priority task. Measures temperature.

Case 4: Priority Inheritance
Low Priority: Executed. Temporarily inherits higher priority to complete quickly.
High Priority: Executed after low priority releases the shared resource.
Medium Priority: Executed after high priority. Measures temperature.
